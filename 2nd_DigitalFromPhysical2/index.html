<h2>Soldiers V. Robots</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>My game is original because it has the robots always moving diagonally, except when the collide with each other, and they fire four bullets each moving diagonally too.</p>
<p></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<p>The robots movement and fireing is all based off a random generator, and the bullets that the player fires always move to the mouse pointer. I made it so the user can switch between characters to add extra diffcui</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p>I learned how to make the player main player sprite switch between other sprites. The easiest part was making the cycle between sprites.
The hardest part was making the sprite that you selected can get hit, move, shoot, and etc.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p>Some conent I took from online and others I grabed from my past games.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<p>This game closely resembles my physical game Soldiers V. Robots. May seem similar to my assignment 3 because I did barrow code from that assignemnt to speed up my programming.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A top down shooter where you manage multiple soldiers and you have to kill all the robots before they kill you squad.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>Soldier</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<p>There is complete randomness for the the robots firing and moving.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<p>This prototype is testing the top down shooter mechanic of the point and shoot along with testing the switching of charaters.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<p>I want the player to feel like he is in the game trying to survive against the robots.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<p>The player can move the soldier with WASD. The player can aim the soldier with the mouse and fire the soldier's gun with the mouse's left click button. Each kill the soldier gets, the player gains 10 points to his score.
The player can switch between three soliders with the 1, 2, 3 and cycle between characters with the F key. The current selected life has alpha of one and the hearts our in order of top to down. Although to confuse the player soldier 1 is in the middle to start and soldier 3 is above him and soldier 2 is below soldier 1.
The player gets plus 100 points if one soldier lives, plus 250 points if two soldiers live, and plus 500 points if three soldiers live. It is gameover if all soldiers die. Orginally I wanted to have it so you could play with five soldiers 
on the field being able to switch between each soldier, but that sounded like too much work so three is enough. Also I wanted to add objects in the world that could provide cover for the soldiers since you
 would have to manage multiple soldiers at once.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<p>The best strategy is to try and not get hit by the robots' bullets because they hurt and you only have one life.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<p>The soldiers are traped in a pixel world surronded by robots that do not like him. The robots shoot four bullets diagonally. These robots are really mad that they have been invaded by this sqad of soldiers. To leave this pixeled world the soldiers must kill all the robots.
The tension will increase as the soldiers kills more and the firing of the robots get faster. Once the soldiers wins he is the forced to replay the game since he is forever trapped in the pixel world.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<p>My target audience are people who like top down shooters.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<p>Play time should be five minutes depending on how long you can survive without all soldiers dieing.</p>
</li>

</ul>
