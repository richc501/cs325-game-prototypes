<h2>The Lone Pirate</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>The game is original because it has a left and right cannon fire.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<p>This game is penpends on rng to spawn all the templars and which each have a chance to fire cannon balls.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p>I learned that I should really not make a game a day before the due date. The easiest part was setting up the player controls. The hardest part was deciding where the templars should be allowed to spawn without spawing on the islands.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p>Some assets I reused from last games and others are grabbed from online</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<p>I used code from all my past games to make this game. The closest game would be my <a href="https://richc501.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Assignment3/">Fighter Stargazer!</a>, but is not an iteration. Just did not have time to find other code to help me, so I chose to use what I learned from the past games I made.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<p> You are a pirate surrounded by templar ships that you need to kill in order to win. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<p> Pirate </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<p> All the templar ships spawn with rng, and all shoot based off rng. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<p> The prototyp goal was to make a ship control of forward based off the direction of the ship and have a drift like turning too. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<p>Players will want to keep playing to get the highest score possible</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<p>The player uses W to move forward, A and D to rotate, and S to drop their anchor. The player can shoot cannon balls using J and K. The templars spawn and move based off rng, and shoot the player. 
The player only has ten health points, and only three lives availble. If the player loses all their lives the player loses. The player can win by killing all the templar ships. As the templar ships number get low the more cannon balls are fire by them.
I wanted to make a left and right boardside fire system, but could figure out the best way to do that. After that I wanted to a system where the pirate captain can jump out of the ship on the island and find tresure at an X mark. Then I had the idea of being able to board and take over other ships. Though I did not get time to do this.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<p>The best stratigy is to use the forts as cover and try and fire J and K at different times since they are on the own independent timers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<p>This game is set in a random ocean somewhere. You are the last of your pirate fleet and you are surroned by templar ships that want to kill you. Your goal is to kill them all before they kill you. You must fire all the cannon balls you have. You hope that their aim is off as you attempt to avenge your fellow fleet that has died. </p>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<p>The target audience would be people that like pretending to play as pirates.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<p> Gameplay can be really fast if you die quick, or about five to eight minutes to kill everyone without dieing.</p>
</li>
