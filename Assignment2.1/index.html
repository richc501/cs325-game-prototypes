<h2>Chicken Parkour</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>My game is original because it involves a chicken doing parkour while cleavers and soda bottles falling from the sky.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<p>I was able to implement wall jumping with my sprite. Using the game.arcade.physics.collide with a function inside.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p>I learned how to use the arcade physics engine and create multiple sprites from groups. 
The easiest part of making this game would be design the tile map and getting the sprites to spawn. 
The hardest part of making this game would be implementing the health, lives and egg collection system with a decent GUI</p>   
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p> All the sounds were grabed from freesound.org and some sounds I slighty modified with audacity. 
Some sprites were grabed from online and some were made with photoshop. And used Tiled to make the tilemap.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<p>You are a chicken and you must collect all your eggs around the map and then get to the other side to win the game.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>Chicken</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<p>I used a platformer style with sprites falling from the sky that can hurt the player. With a random number genterator determing the which x position it'll spawn at.  </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<p>My mechanic I was evaluating was wall jumping, getting to the other side to win while testing a health and lives system.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<p>I want my players to feel like they are a chicken trying to get all the eggs and get to the other side while feeling like they will die trying.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<p>W is jump, A and D are left and right. To wall jump left or right on a block HOLD W + D/A and the let go of D/A when you touch the block. To wall jump forward left or right on a block HOLD W + HOLD A/D.
The player can wall jump left or right with a wall next to the player. The player can use the wall jump mechanic to climb up a wall and fling themselves the direction they are facing. 
The player goal is to find and collect all the collectable eggs before the player dies. Mean while there are cleavers that damage the player that fall from the sky and stay on the ground trying to kill the player and exploding soda bottles also falling from the sky.
However, the exploding soda bottles does not hurt the player, but cause some of the cleavers to be removed. Only the cleavers or the player can cause the soda bottles to explode. If the player is caught in the explosion, then the player is forced in the air by the explosion.
I wanted to include the water in the game now that is just a background layer in the tile map and make the water randomly transform to boiling peanut oil. So when the chicken trys to go take a swim the peanut oil causes a instant game over.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<p> The best strategy is to go backwards early and move quickly since cleavers spawn every second and soda bottles spawns every five seconds around your sprite.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<p>My game is set in a pocket demenion where the god of this demenion is a mad chef that wants his chicken dinner now. The sole chicken doesn't want to become his chicken dinner, but has lost all his eggs. This chicken must find all his eggs and get to the other side to save himself from the mad chef. 
This mad chef is enraged and starts throwing cleavers to hurt this poor chicken and even soda bottles that explode on imact from the chicken or the cleavers. This causes the chicken to have mental break downs, but overall he just want to get to the other side without becoming chicken dinner.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<p>My target audience would be people that love platformers.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<p>The game takes about two to three minutes to complete if you know where all the eggs are. But if you dont it may take about two extra minutes to back track through the map.
The game really depends on your skill level and how lucky you get with the RNG not killing your chicken.</p>
