<h2>Chicken Parkour</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>My game is original because it involves a chicken doing parkour while cleavers and soda bottles falling from the sky.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<p>I was able to implement wall jumping with my sprite. Using the game.arcade.physics.collide with a function inside.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p>I learned how to use the arcade physics engine and create multiple sprites from groups. 
The easiest part of making this game would be design the tile map and getting the sprites to spawn. 
The hardest part of making this game would be implementing the health, lives and egg collection system with a decent GUI</p>   
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p> All the sounds were grabed from freesound.org and some sounds I slighty modified with audacity. 
Some sprites were grabed from online and some were made with photoshop. And used Tiled to make the tilemap.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<p>You are a chicken and you must collect all your eggs around the map and then get to the other side to win the game.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>Chicken</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<p>I used a platformer style with sprites falling from the sky. With a random number genterator determing the which x position it'll spawn at.  </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<p>My mechanic I was evaluating was wall jumping and getting to the other side to win.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<p>I want my players to feel like they are a chicken trying to get all the eggs and get to the other side while feeling like they will die trying.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<p>W is jump, A and D are left and right. To wall jump left or right on a block HOLD W + D/A and the let go of D/A when you touch the block. To wall jump forward left or right on a block HOLD W + HOLD A/D.
The player can wall jump left or right with a wall next to the player. The player can use the wall jump mechanic to climb up a wall and fling themselves the direction they are facing. 
The player goal is to find and collect all the collectable eggs before the player dies. Mean while there are cleavers that damage the player that fall from the sky and stay on the ground trying to kill the player and exploding soda bottles also falling from the sky.
However, the exploding soda bottles does not hurt the player, but cause some of the cleavers to be removed. Only the cleavers or the player can cause the soda bottles to explode. If the player is caught in the explosion, then the player is forced in the air by the explosion.</p>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
