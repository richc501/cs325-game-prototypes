<h2>Chicken Parkour</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is original because it involves a chicken doing parkour while cleavers and soda bottles falling from the sky.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I was able to implement wall jumping with my sprite. Using the game.arcade.physics.collide with a function inside.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p>I learned how to use the arcade physics engine and create multiple sprites from groups. 
The easiest part of making this game would be design the tile map and getting the sprites to spawn. 
The hardest part of making this game would be implementing the health, lives and egg collection system with a decent GUI</p>   
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p> All the sounds were grabed from freesound.org and some sounds I slighty modified with audacity. 
Some sprites were grabed from online and some were made with photoshop. And used Tiled to make the tilemap.</p>
