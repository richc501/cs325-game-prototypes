<h2>Assignment 1</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>My game is original because the club is what you move and then hit the ball with it. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<p>My game uses P2 physics and has impact events when you hit the ball with the club.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<p> From the prototype, I learned how to use P2 Physics, add a tiled maped to the world, add sound, and use impact events. </p> 
<p> The easiest part was adding the controls and the hardest part was using tiled, importing the tiled map, and adding collision to it. </p> 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<p> I made all images with photoshop and used audacity to cut the sound into pieces </p>
<ul>
<li>Golf Hit Sounds: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/98334/">Golf Hit Sounds</a></li>
<li>Golf Ball: <a href="assets/golfball.png">Golf Ball</a></li>
<li>Golf Club: <a href="assets/golfclub.png">Golf Club</a></li>
<li>Tiles: <a href="assets/ground.png">Ground etc.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game closest resembles the phaser example csv-map-with-p2 to get the tile map, the world move example also, and used other examples to get impact events working, with sound effects. To get the controls working with wasd i found a post with a soltution on how to do it on html5gamedevs.com.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
<p>Hit the ball with the club.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>Golfer</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<p>When you hit the ball there is a random number generator that picks 1 out of the 4 golf hit sounds</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<p> The goal is to get a feel for the controls and how the game sounds when you hit the ball</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<p> I want players to experiance hitting the ball with the club. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<p> The player can move the club up, down, left, or right with wasd. Also with q and e, the player can then rotate the club left or right. The system will play a golf hit sound when the club hits the ball. Your job is to try and get the ball in the top right and left light green areas without letting the ball hit the bottom. There is nothing stoping the player from having the ball go to the bottom light green area and no scoring system when you get the ball in the top right and left light green area. After that you would score then the ball would reset, but not your club.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<p> The strategy is to hit the ball. That is all for now. </p> 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
<p> The game is set in a random world I made in Tiled, and your character is the golf club. Your golf club is forever traped in here with only one ball to hit until the player chooses to close the browser. The player is the only one that can make the golf club have a purpose in moving the club. It won't have any other life besides hitting this single ball in this browser. This game is purely abstract because I wanted to use one of theme cards some way. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<p>My demograpic would be my fellow peers and my professor.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
<p> The game is short, but it depends the user to stop playing. </p>
</li>
